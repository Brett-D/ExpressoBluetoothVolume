# ExpressoBluetoothVolume
expressojs Bluetooth repo

This is a repo to save my progress with the https://www.puck-js.com/go

The goal of this project is to create a volue control device tied to the accelerometer and gyro

Also create a microphone mute button to use in conjuction with my headphones on my computer. 

This is also a learning platform to learn how to use the various BLE pieces.
